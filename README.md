# ECG_neural_network
Prediction of types of ECG for PhysionNet's data.
This challenge comes from the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00794.pdf which, based on PhysionNet's MIT-BIH and PTB Diagnostics datasets, performs a classification of different types of electrocardiograms with an accuracy of 93.4% for arrhythmias and 95.9% for MI with the use of RNN.
